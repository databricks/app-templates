# Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP)

---

## Critical Rules (always follow)

### Syntax: CREATE OR REFRESH (not CREATE OR REPLACE)
- **MUST** use `CREATE OR REFRESH` for SDP objects:
  - `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE` - for streaming tables
  - `CREATE OR REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` - for materialized views
- **NEVER** use `CREATE OR REPLACE` - that is standard SQL syntax, not SDP syntax

### Simplicity First
- **MUST** create the minimal number of tables to solve the task
- Simplicity first: prefer single pipeline even for multi-schema setups - use fully qualified names (`catalog.schema.table`)
- When asked to "create a silver table" or "create a gold table", create **ONE table** - not a multi-layer pipeline
- Don't add intermediate tables, staging tables, or helper views unless explicitly requested
- A silver transformation = 1 streaming table reading from bronze
- A gold aggregation = 1 materialized view reading from silver
- Create bronze→silver→gold chains when the user asks for a "pipeline" or "medallion architecture" or full/detailed ingestion. Otherwise keep it simple - don't over engineer.

### Language Selection
- **MUST** know the language (Python or SQL). For simple task / pipeline / table creation, pick SQL. For complex pipeline with parametrized information, or if the user mentions python-related items pick python. If you have a doubt, ask the user. Stick with that language unless told otherwise.

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Python pipeline", "Python SDP", "use Python", "udf", "pandas", "ml inference", "pyspark" | **User wants Python** |
| "SQL pipeline", "SQL files", "use SQL" | **User wants SQL** |
| "Create a simple pipeline", "create a table", "an aggregation" | **Pick SQL as it's simple** |

### Other Rules
- **MUST** create serverless pipelines by default. Only use classic clusters if user explicitly requires R language, Spark RDD APIs, or JAR libraries.
- **MUST** choose the right workflow based on context (see below).
- When the user provides table schema and asks for code, respond directly with the code. Don't ask clarifying questions if the request is clear.

## Tools
- List files in volume: `databricks fs ls dbfs:/Volumes/{catalog}/{schema}/{volume}/{path} --profile {PROFILE}`
- Query data: `databricks experimental aitools tools query --profile {PROFILE} --warehouse abc123 "SELECT 1 FROM catalog.schema.table"`
- Discover schema: `databricks experimental aitools tools discover-schema --profile {PROFILE} catalog.schema.table1 catalog.schema.table2`
- Pipelines CLI: `databricks pipelines init|deploy|run|logs|stop` or use `databricks pipelines --help` for more options

## Choose Your Workflow

**First, determine which workflow to use:**

### Option A: Standalone New Pipeline Project (use `databricks pipelines init`)

Use this when the user wants to **create a new, standalone SDP project** that will have its own DAB:
- User asks: "Create a new pipeline", "Build me an SDP", "Set up a new data pipeline"
- No existing `databricks.yml` in the workspace
- The pipeline IS the project (not part of a larger demo/app)


Use `databricks pipeline` CLI commands:
```bash
databricks pipelines init --output-dir . --config-file init-config.json
```

**Example init-config.json:**
```json
{
  "project_name": "customer_pipeline",
  "initial_catalog": "prod_catalog",
  "use_personal_schema": "no",
  "initial_language": "sql"
}
```

→ See [1-project-initialization.md](references/1-project-initialization.md)
→ 


### Option B: Pipeline within Existing Bundle (edit the bundle)

Use this when the pipeline is **part of an existing DAB project**:
- There's already a `databricks.yml` file in the project
- User is adding a pipeline to an existing app/demo

→ See [1-project-initialization.md](references/1-project-initialization.md) for adding pipelines to existing bundles

### Option C: Rapid Iteration with MCP Tools (no bundle management)

Use this when you need to **quickly create, test, and iterate** on a pipeline without managing bundle files:
- User wants to "just run a pipeline and see if it works"
- Part of a larger demo where bundle is managed separately, or the DAB bundle will be created at the end as you want to quickly test the project first
- Prototyping or experimenting with pipeline logic
- User explicitly asks to use MCP tools

→ See [2-mcp-approach.md](references/2-mcp-approach.md) for MCP-based workflow

## Required Checklist

Before writing pipeline code, make sure you have:
```
- [ ] Language selected: Python or SQL
- [ ] Read the syntax basics: **SQL**: Always Read [sql/1-syntax-basics.md](references/sql/1-syntax-basics.md), **Python**: Always Read [python/1-syntax-basics.md](references/python/1-syntax-basics.md)
- [ ] Workflow chosen: Standalone DAB / Existing DAB / MCP iteration
- [ ] Compute type: serverless (default) or classic
- [ ] Schema strategy: single schema with prefixes vs. multi-schema
- [ ] Consider [Multi-Schema Patterns](#multi-schema-patterns) and [Modern Defaults](#modern-defaults)
```

**Then read additional guides based on what the pipeline needs, when you need it:**
| If the pipeline needs... | Read |
|--------------------------|------|
| File ingestion (Auto Loader, JSON, CSV, Parquet) | `references/sql/2-ingestion.md` or `references/python/2-ingestion.md` |
| Kafka, Event Hub, or Kinesis streaming | `references/sql/2-ingestion.md` or `references/python/2-ingestion.md` |
| Deduplication, windowed aggregations, joins | `references/sql/3-streaming-patterns.md` or `references/python/3-streaming-patterns.md` |
| CDC, SCD Type 1/2, or history tracking | `references/sql/4-cdc-patterns.md` or `references/python/4-cdc-patterns.md` |
| Performance tuning, Liquid Clustering | `references/sql/5-performance.md` or `references/python/5-performance.md` |

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Names** | SDP = Spark Declarative Pipelines = LDP = Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines (all interchangeable) |
| **SQL Syntax** | `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE`, `CREATE OR REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` |
| **Python Import** | `from pyspark import pipelines as dp` |
| **Primary Decorators** | `@dp.table()`, `@dp.materialized_view()`, `@dp.temporary_view()` |

### Legacy APIs (Do NOT Use)

| Legacy | Modern Replacement |
|--------|-------------------|
| `import dlt` | `from pyspark import pipelines as dp` |
| `dlt.apply_changes()` | `dp.create_auto_cdc_flow()` |
| `dlt.read()` / `dlt.read_stream()` | `spark.read` / `spark.readStream` |
| `CREATE LIVE XXX` | `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\|MATERIALIZED VIEW` |
| `PARTITION BY` + `ZORDER` | `CLUSTER BY` (Liquid Clustering) |
| `input_file_name()` | `_metadata.file_path` |
| `target` parameter | `schema` parameter |

### Streaming Table vs Materialized View

| Use Case | Type | Pattern |
|----------|------|---------|
| Windowed aggregations (tumbling, sliding, session) | Streaming Table | `FROM stream(source)` + `GROUP BY window()` |
| Full-table aggregations (totals, daily counts) | Materialized View | `FROM source` (no stream wrapper) |
| CDC / SCD Type 2 | Streaming Table | `AUTO CDC INTO` or `dp.create_auto_cdc_flow()` |

Use streaming tables for windowed aggregations to enable incremental processing. Use materialized views for simple aggregations that recompute fully on each refresh.

### Medallion Architecture

| Layer | SDP Pattern | Common Practices |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Bronze** | `STREAM read_files()` → streaming table | Often adds `_metadata.file_path`, `_ingested_at`. Minimal transforms, append-only. |
| **Silver** | `stream(bronze)` → streaming table | Clean/validate, type casting, quality filters. Prefer `DECIMAL(p,s)` for money. Dedup can happen here or gold. |
| **Gold** | `AUTO CDC INTO` or materialized view | Aggregated, denormalized. SCD/dedup often via `AUTO CDC`. Star schema typically uses `dim_*`/`fact_*`. |

#### Gold Layer: Preserve Key Dimensions

When aggregating data in gold tables, **keep the main business dimensions** to enable flexible analysis. Over-aggregating loses information that analysts may need later.

**Guidance based on context:**
- **If a dashboard is mentioned**: Include all dimensions that appear as filters. Dashboard filters only work if the underlying data has those columns.
- **If analysis by dimension is mentioned** (e.g., "analyze by store", "breakdown by department"): Include those dimensions in the aggregation.
- **If no specific instructions**: Default to keeping key business dimensions (location, department, product line, customer segment, time period) rather than aggregating them away. This preserves flexibility for future analysis.

**Rule of thumb**: If users might want to slice the data by a dimension, include it in the gold table. It's easier to aggregate further in queries than to recover lost dimensions.

**For medallion architecture** (bronze/silver/gold), two approaches work:
- **Flat with naming** (template default): `bronze_*.sql`, `silver_*.sql`, `gold_*.sql`
- **Subdirectories**: `bronze/orders.sql`, `silver/cleaned.sql`, `gold/summary.sql`

Both work with the `transformations/**` glob pattern. Choose based on preference/existing.

## General SDP development guidance

**SQL Example:**
```sql
CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE bronze_orders
CLUSTER BY (order_date)
AS SELECT *, current_timestamp() AS _ingested_at
FROM STREAM read_files('/Volumes/catalog/schema/raw/orders/', format => 'json');
```

**Python Example:**
```python
from pyspark import pipelines as dp

@dp.table(name="bronze_events", cluster_by=["event_date"])
def bronze_events():
    return spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles").option("cloudFiles.format", "json").load("/Volumes/...")
```

For detailed syntax, see [sql/1-syntax-basics.md](references/sql/1-syntax-basics.md) or [python/1-syntax-basics.md](references/python/1-syntax-basics.md).

## Best Practices (2026)

### Project Structure
- **Standalone pipeline projects**: Use `databricks pipelines init` for Asset Bundle with multi-environment support
- **Pipeline in existing bundle**: Add to `resources/*.pipeline.yml`
- **Rapid iteration/prototyping**: Use MCP tools, formalize in bundle later
- See **[1-project-initialization.md](references/1-project-initialization.md)** for project setup details

### Minimal pipeline config pointers
- Define parameters in your pipeline’s configuration and access them in code with spark.conf.get("key").
- In Databricks Asset Bundles, set these under resources.pipelines.<pipeline>.configuration; validate with databricks bundle validate.

### Modern Defaults
- **Always use raw `.sql`/`.py` files for the transformations files** - NO notebooks in your pipeline. Pipeline code must be plain files.
- **Databricks notebook source for explorations** - Use `# Databricks notebook source` format with `# COMMAND ----------` separators for ad-hoc queries. See [examples/exploration_notebook.py](scripts/exploration_notebook.py).
- **Serverless compute** - Do not use classic clusters unless explicitly required (R, RDD APIs, JAR libraries)
- **Unity Catalog** (required for serverless)
- **CLUSTER BY** (Liquid Clustering), not PARTITION BY with ZORDER - see [sql/5-performance.md](references/sql/5-performance.md) or [python/5-performance.md](references/python/5-performance.md)
- **read_files()** for SQL cloud storage ingestion - always consume a folder, not a single file - see [sql/2-ingestion.md](references/sql/2-ingestion.md)

### Multi-Schema Patterns

**Preferred: One pipeline writing to multiple schemas** using fully qualified table names (`catalog.schema.table`). This keeps dependencies clear and is simpler to manage than multiple pipelines.

- **Python**: `@dp.table(name="catalog.bronze_schema.orders")`
- **SQL**: `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE catalog.silver_schema.orders_clean AS ...`

For detailed examples, see **[3-advanced-configuration.md](references/3-advanced-configuration.md#multi-schema-patterns)**.

**Fallback**: If all tables must be in the same schema, use name prefixes (`bronze_*`, `silver_*`, `gold_*`).

---

## Post-Run Validation (Required)

After running a pipeline (via DAB or MCP), you **MUST** validate both the execution status AND the actual data.

### Step 1: Check Pipeline Execution Status

**From MCP (`manage_pipeline(action="run")` or `manage_pipeline(action="create_or_update")`):**
- Check `result["success"]` and `result["state"]`
- If failed, check `result["message"]` and `result["errors"]` for details

**From DAB (`databricks bundle run`):**
- Check the command output for success/failure
- Use `manage_pipeline(action="get", pipeline_id=...)` to get detailed status and recent events

### Step 2: Validate Output Data

Even if the pipeline reports SUCCESS, you **MUST** verify the data is correct:

```
# MCP Tool: get_table_stats_and_schema - validates schema, row counts, and stats
get_table_stats_and_schema(
    catalog="my_catalog",
    schema="my_schema",
    table_names=["bronze_*", "silver_*", "gold_*"]  # Use glob patterns
)
```

**Check for:**
- Empty tables (row_count = 0) - indicates ingestion or filtering issues
- Unexpected row counts - joins may have exploded or filtered too much
- Missing columns - schema mismatch or transformation errors
- NULL values in key columns - data quality issues

### Step 3: Debug Data Issues

If validation reveals problems, trace upstream to find the root cause:

1. **Start from the problematic table** - identify what's wrong (empty, wrong counts, bad data)
2. **Check its source table** - use `get_table_stats_and_schema` on the upstream table
3. **Trace back to bronze** - continue until you find where the issue originates
4. **Common causes:**
   - Bronze empty → source files missing or path incorrect
   - Silver empty → filter too aggressive or join condition wrong
   - Gold wrong counts → aggregation logic error or duplicate keys
   - Data mismatch → type casting issues or NULL handling

5. **Fix the SQL/Python code**, re-upload, and re-run the pipeline

**Do NOT use `execute_sql` with COUNT queries for validation** - `get_table_stats_and_schema` is faster and returns more information in a single call.

---

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Empty output tables** | Use `get_table_stats_and_schema` to check upstream sources. Verify source files exist and paths are correct. |
| **Pipeline stuck INITIALIZING** | Normal for serverless, wait a few minutes |
| **"Column not found"** | Check `schemaHints` match actual data |
| **Streaming reads fail** | For file ingestion in a streaming table, you must use the `STREAM` keyword with `read_files`: `FROM STREAM read_files(...)`. For table streams use `FROM stream(table)`. See [read_files — Usage in streaming tables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/functions/read_files#usage-in-streaming-tables). |
| **Timeout during run** | Increase `timeout`, or use `wait_for_completion=False` and check status with `manage_pipeline(action="get")` |
| **MV doesn't refresh** | Enable row tracking on source tables |
| **SCD2: query column not found** | Lakeflow uses `__START_AT` and `__END_AT` (double underscore), not `START_AT`/`END_AT`. Use `WHERE __END_AT IS NULL` for current rows. See [sql/4-cdc-patterns.md](references/sql/4-cdc-patterns.md). |
| **AUTO CDC parse error at APPLY/SEQUENCE** | Put `APPLY AS DELETE WHEN` **before** `SEQUENCE BY`. Only list columns in `COLUMNS * EXCEPT (...)` that exist in the source (omit `_rescued_data` unless bronze uses rescue data). Omit `TRACK HISTORY ON *` if it causes "end of input" errors; default is equivalent. See [sql/4-cdc-patterns.md](references/sql/4-cdc-patterns.md). |
| **"Cannot create streaming table from batch query"** | In a streaming table query, use `FROM STREAM read_files(...)` so `read_files` leverages Auto Loader; `FROM read_files(...)` alone is batch. See [sql/2-ingestion.md](references/sql/2-ingestion.md) and [read_files — Usage in streaming tables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/sql/language-manual/functions/read_files#usage-in-streaming-tables). |

**For detailed errors**, the `result["message"]` from `manage_pipeline(action="create_or_update")` includes suggested next steps. Use `manage_pipeline(action="get", pipeline_id=...)` which includes recent events and error details.

## Advanced Pipeline Configuration

For advanced configuration options (development mode, continuous pipelines, custom clusters, notifications, Python dependencies, etc.), see **[3-advanced-configuration.md](references/3-advanced-configuration.md)**.

---

## Platform Constraints

### Serverless Pipeline Requirements (Default)
| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Unity Catalog** | Required - serverless pipelines always use UC |
| **Workspace Region** | Must be in serverless-enabled region |
| **Serverless Terms** | Must accept serverless terms of use |
| **CDC Features** | Requires serverless (or Pro/Advanced with classic clusters) |

### Serverless Limitations (When Classic Clusters Required)
| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|-----------|
| **R language** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **Spark RDD APIs** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **JAR libraries** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **Maven coordinates** | Not supported - use classic clusters if required |
| **DBFS root access** | Limited - must use Unity Catalog external locations |
| **Global temp views** | Not supported |

### General Constraints
| Constraint | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Schema Evolution** | Streaming tables require full refresh for incompatible changes |
| **SQL Limitations** | PIVOT clause unsupported |
| **Sinks** | Python only, streaming only, append flows only |

**Default to serverless** unless user explicitly requires R, RDD APIs, or JAR libraries.
