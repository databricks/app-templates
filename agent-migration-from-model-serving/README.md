Use this directory for AI-assisted migration from an existing MLFlow ResponsesAgent (Model Serving Endpoint) to a Databricks App
To migrate your app:
Option 1: With Claude Code (recommended)
```
 cd agent-migration-from-model-serving
 claude
```
 
Then ask:
  "Migrate my Model Serving endpoint 'my-agent-endpoint' to a Databricks App"

Option 2: With any LLM agent
  1. Copy the contents of AGENTS.md into your LLM agent's context
  2. Provide your endpoint name and ask it to migrate
