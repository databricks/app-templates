# Lakebase Postgres Autoscaling

**FIRST**: Use the parent `databricks-core` skill for CLI basics, authentication, and profile selection.

Lakebase is Databricks' serverless Postgres-compatible database (similar to Neon). It provides fully managed OLTP storage with autoscaling, branching, and scale-to-zero.

Manage Lakebase Postgres projects, branches, endpoints, and databases via `databricks postgres` CLI commands.

## Resource Hierarchy

```
Project (top-level container)
  └── Branch (isolated database environment, copy-on-write)
        ├── Endpoint (read-write or read-only)
        ├── Database (standard Postgres DB)
        └── Role (Postgres role)
```

- **Project**: Top-level container. Creating one auto-provisions a `production` branch and a `primary` read-write endpoint.
- **Branch**: Isolated database environment sharing storage with parent (copy-on-write). States: `READY`, `ARCHIVED`.
- **Endpoint** (called **Compute** in the Lakebase UI): Compute resource powering a branch. Types: `ENDPOINT_TYPE_READ_WRITE`, `ENDPOINT_TYPE_READ_ONLY` (read replica).
- **Database**: Standard Postgres database within a branch. Default: `databricks_postgres`.
- **Role**: Postgres role within a branch. Manage roles via `databricks postgres create-role -h`.

### Resource Name Formats

| Resource | Format                                                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project  | `projects/{project_id}`                                              |
| Branch   | `projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}`                         |
| Endpoint | `projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/endpoints/{endpoint_id}` |
| Database | `projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}/databases/{database_id}` |

All IDs: 1-63 characters, start with lowercase letter, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only (RFC 1123).

## CLI Discovery — ALWAYS Do This First

> **Note:** "Lakebase" is the product name; the CLI command group is `postgres`. All commands use `databricks postgres ...`.

**Do NOT guess command syntax.** Discover available commands and their usage dynamically:

```bash
# List all postgres subcommands
databricks postgres -h

# Get detailed usage for any subcommand (flags, args, JSON fields)
databricks postgres <subcommand> -h
```

Run `databricks postgres -h` before constructing any command. Run `databricks postgres <subcommand> -h` to discover exact flags, positional arguments, and JSON spec fields for that subcommand.

## Create a Project

> **Do NOT list projects before creating.**

```bash
databricks postgres create-project <PROJECT_ID> \
  --json '{"spec": {"display_name": "<DISPLAY_NAME>"}}' \
  --profile <PROFILE>
```

- Auto-creates: `production` branch + `primary` read-write endpoint (1 CU min/max, scale-to-zero)
- Long-running operation; the CLI waits for completion by default. Use `--no-wait` to return immediately.
- Run `databricks postgres create-project -h` for all available spec fields (e.g. `pg_version`).

After creation, verify the auto-provisioned resources:

```bash
databricks postgres list-branches projects/<PROJECT_ID> --profile <PROFILE>
databricks postgres list-endpoints projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID> --profile <PROFILE>
databricks postgres list-databases projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID> --profile <PROFILE>
```

## Autoscaling

Endpoints use **compute units (CU)** for autoscaling. Configure min/max CU via `create-endpoint` or `update-endpoint`. Run `databricks postgres create-endpoint -h` to see all spec fields.

Scale-to-zero is enabled by default. When idle, compute scales down to zero; it resumes in seconds on next connection.

## Branches

Branches are copy-on-write snapshots of an existing branch. Use them for **experimentation**: testing schema migrations, trying queries, or previewing data changes -- without affecting production.

```bash
databricks postgres create-branch projects/<PROJECT_ID> <BRANCH_ID> \
  --json '{
    "spec": {
      "source_branch": "projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<SOURCE_BRANCH_ID>",
      "no_expiry": true
    }
  }' --profile <PROFILE>
```

Branches require an expiration policy: use `"no_expiry": true` for permanent branches.

When done experimenting, delete the branch. Protected branches must be unprotected first -- use `update-branch` to set `spec.is_protected` to `false`, then delete:

```bash
# Step 1 — unprotect
databricks postgres update-branch projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID> \
  --json '{"spec": {"is_protected": false}}' --profile <PROFILE>

# Step 2 — delete (run -h to confirm positional arg format for your CLI version)
databricks postgres delete-branch projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID> \
  --profile <PROFILE>
```

**Never delete the `production` branch** — it is the authoritative branch auto-provisioned at project creation.

## What's Next

### Build a Databricks App

After creating a Lakebase project, scaffold a Databricks App connected to it.

**Step 1 — Discover branch name** (use `.name` from a `READY` branch):

```bash
databricks postgres list-branches projects/<PROJECT_ID> --profile <PROFILE>
```

**Step 2 — Discover database name** (use `.name` from the desired database; `<BRANCH_ID>` is the branch ID, not the full resource name):

```bash
databricks postgres list-databases projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID> --profile <PROFILE>
```

**Step 3 — Scaffold the app** with the `lakebase` feature:

```bash
databricks apps init --name <APP_NAME> \
  --features lakebase \
  --set "lakebase.postgres.branch=<BRANCH_NAME>" \
  --set "lakebase.postgres.database=<DATABASE_NAME>" \
  --run none --profile <PROFILE>
```

Where `<BRANCH_NAME>` is the full resource name (e.g. `projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID>`) and `<DATABASE_NAME>` is the full resource name (e.g. `projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID>/databases/<DB_ID>`).

For the full app development workflow, use the **`databricks-apps`** skill.

### Schema Permissions for Deployed Apps

When a Lakebase database is used by a deployed Databricks App, the app's Service Principal has `CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE` permission, which means it can create new objects but **cannot access any existing schemas or tables** (including `public`). The SP must create the schema itself to become its owner.

**ALWAYS deploy the app before running it locally.** This is the #1 source of Lakebase permission errors.

When deployed, the app's Service Principal runs the schema initialization SQL (e.g. `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app_data`), creating the schema and tables — and becoming their **owner**. Only the owner (or a superuser) can access those objects.

**If you run locally first**, your personal credentials create the schema and become the owner. The deployed Service Principal then **cannot access it** — even though it has `CAN_CONNECT_AND_CREATE` — because it didn't create it and cannot access existing schemas.

**Correct workflow:**

1. **Deploy first**: `databricks apps deploy <APP_NAME> --profile <PROFILE>` — verify with `databricks apps get <APP_NAME> --profile <PROFILE>` that the app is deployed before proceeding
2. **Grant local access** _(if needed)_: if you're not the project creator, assign `databricks_superuser` to your identity via the Lakebase UI. Project creators already have sufficient access.
3. **Develop locally**: your credentials get DML access (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) to SP-owned schemas

> **Note:** Project creators already have access to SP-owned schemas. Other team members need `databricks_superuser` (grants full DML but **not DDL**). If you need to alter the schema during local development, redeploy the app to apply DDL changes.

**If you already ran locally first** and hit `permission denied` after deploying: the schema is owned by your personal credentials, not the SP. **⚠️ Do NOT drop the schema without asking the user first** — dropping it (`DROP SCHEMA <name> CASCADE`) **deletes all data** in that schema. Ask the user how they'd like to proceed:

- **Option A (destructive):** Drop the schema and redeploy so the SP recreates it. Only safe if the schema has no valuable data.
- **Option B (manual):** The user can reassign ownership or manually grant the SP access, preserving existing data.

### Other Workflows

**Connect a Postgres client**
Get the connection string from the endpoint, then connect with psql, DBeaver, or any standard Postgres client.

```bash
databricks postgres get-endpoint projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID>/endpoints/<ENDPOINT_ID> --profile <PROFILE>
```

**Manage roles and permissions**
Create Postgres roles and grant access to databases or schemas.

```bash
databricks postgres create-role -h   # discover role spec fields
```

**Add a read-only endpoint**
Create a read replica for analytics or reporting workloads to avoid contention on the primary read-write endpoint.

```bash
databricks postgres create-endpoint projects/<PROJECT_ID>/branches/<BRANCH_ID> <ENDPOINT_ID> \
  --json '{"spec": {"type": "ENDPOINT_TYPE_READ_ONLY"}}' --profile <PROFILE>
```
